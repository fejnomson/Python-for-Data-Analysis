foo = 'bar'
foo
_i39 # input in cell 39
_39 # output in cell 39
# So you can quickly reference input and output cells with '_' and '_i'
exec(_i48) # execute an old cell

# this functionality keeps large objects from being garbage collections,
# 	because they're stored in the cell input and output caches; would have
# 	to manage if large datasets and memory problems

# can store command in python object (list or string)

# anything after '!' is exectued in the system shell, so you can delete
# 	or copy files or directories, etc.
# can store output of sehll command in variable: var = !<expr>

# Skipping a lot of command line stuff, don't really use
